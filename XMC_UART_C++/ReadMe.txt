#XMC4500 FreeRTOS C and C++ interaction

This repo contains c++ version of UART in FreeRTOS which explains interaction of c and c++ within RTOS environment.

Motive of this is to explain How C++ can be used for Microcontrollers in RTOS environment while using the existing C libraries.

Description:
1. UART App contains C++ version of DAVE generated code wth some addition/modifications.
2. Using Interrupt handlers in C++ environment
3. It is a glimpse of how tool generated C++ code might look like and how it can be interfaced with existing C code libraries.
4. Small execution of How C++ can be used in RTOS environment
5. Loading initialization functions for peripherals and objects before Main entry

 and rest if you can find something for yourself!
