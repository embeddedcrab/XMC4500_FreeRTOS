This demo project contains simple led blinking using c++ class method which implements the GPIO functionality. (fast and usable)

It has a class for LED Task which accepts the GPIO port data as input and others..

Port pins P1.0 and P1.1 has been shown in example which toggle for every 500ms continuously.

Example shows how c++ can be used with FreeRTOS kernel for creating tasks. [May vary according to functionality and usage]

Thats it!! :-)
